Hello There!

I'm Itay, EE & Physics graduate from TAU, currently pursuing my CS masters at the Technion. 

My research area is operating systems internals, focusing on efficient & secure DMA methods, as well as the io uring subsystem.

My passion is low level research. \
On my free time I mainly focus on system exploitation and vuln research.
