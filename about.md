Hello!

I'm Itay, EE & Physics graduate from TAU, currently pursuing my CS masters at the Technion. \
My academic research area is operating systems internals, focusing on efficient & secure DMA methods, as well as the Linux kernel's IO uring subsystem. \
My passion is low level research, and binary exploitation in particular.

I am ranked 47th place on [pwnable.kr][pwnable-kr]. \
You can find few of my projects at GitHub: [itaysnir][itaysnir-page]

Other than computers, I really like doing [krav maga][krav-maga], classic boxing and [bachata][bachata].
