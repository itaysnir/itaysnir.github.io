Hello!

I'm Itay, EE & Physics graduate from TAU, and currently doing my CS masters at the Technion. 

My main interests are kernel development, system exploitation and vuln research. 
This site is basically a huge logger, documenting what i research on my free time. 

You can find few of my projects at GitHub:
