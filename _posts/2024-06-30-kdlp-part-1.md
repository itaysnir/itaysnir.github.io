## Lecture 6

This lecture deals with execution contexts, and syscalls internals in particular. \
For x86-32, the syscall request is being issued via `int 0x80`, hence involves dereference of `IDT[0x80]`. For x86-64, `syscall` is used. For arm64, `svc`. \
If we would issue `msr VBAR_EL1, x0` from userspace, the program shall crash with an "illegal instruction". `msr` reads from model-specific register, into the second operand, `x0` in this case. Indeed, `VBAR_EL1` serves as the specific reg - vector base address register, execution level 1. Hence, by trying to access a register that belongs to execution level 1 from userspace, the kernel terminates our process. 

### Execution Context

Just CPU registers state. Hence, context === all registers values. \
For example, `setjmp(3)` saves the current state of the program, while `longjmp(3)` restores it. \
Another example are usermode threads. Recall they share heap, code, data - while having their own stack and registers. 

### Kernelspace and userspace

The main difference is their privilege level. \
An important simplification - kernelspace execution context can be subdivided, to code that *runs on behalf of a particular userspace process*, or *code that runs on its own behalf* (for example, kthreads or interrupt handlers). \
Context switch is capture of the current CPU regs state, and load of the previously-saved CPU regs. \
Kernel context switch is just as a regular processes context switch, but also changes the privileges. 

### Re-entrancy

If multiple invocations of a function can safely run concurrently, it is considered as reentrant. \
On single threaded usermode, this term may be used within signal handlers. \
If there's at least one non-reentrant call within a function, it is considered as non-reentrant at all.


### task_struct

Linux's PCB, defined within `include/linux/sched.h`. \
Each `pid` is mapped to a unique `task_struct`. \
In particular, `current` denotes the `task_struct` of process in current execution context. Notice it can also refer to the currently running kernel thread. \
Moreover, we cant always rely on this - as there are kernel contexts that dont have any process attached. \
Its implementation is architecture-specific.

### pid, tid, tgpid

When we refer to kernelspace `pid`, we actually mean `tid` within userspace. When we refer to kernelspace `tgid`, we actually mean userspace `pid`. \
We can learn this by looking at `getpid, gettid` syscalls within `kernel/sys.c`, defined via `SYSCALL_DEFINE0` (as it takes 0 arguments). \
Interesting to note, is that `getpid` takes namespaces into account, as well as locking. If we would call `getpid` from a container (having `/bin/sh` as its initial process), we should get `pid = 1`. 

Why's there a distinguish between `pid` and `tgid` though? \
Before Linux 2.6, there were only `pid`s. We could share address space between processes via `clone`, which allowed thread-like behavior. However, these processes were too independent (no shared signals for example). Hence, `tgid` was introduced. It required both kernel and userspace changes: \
For userspace, C library was now hardened for concurrency, and introduced `tid` concept to subdivide `pid` (as the term `pid` was already used). \
For kernelspace, `tgid` concept was introduced, as threads were already implemented in the kernel. To implement group of threads, which is what processes are, `tgid` was used - which groups kernel `pid`s together. 

### Syscalls 

`strace` is an awesome tool, which traces system calls as well as signals. It can also show the resources limits of a process.  

We'd like syscalls to be both fast and secured. Spectre is an example of that tradeoff implications - speculating both sides of an `if` statement, a speed optimization, while leaving side channels implications (cache memory changes) that could lead to information disclosure. \
Moreover, we'd like them to be stable and re-entrant. The kernel code must be reentrant. 

Regarding security, userspace-kernelspace is a classic scenario of the "Confused deputy problem", where an unprivileged entity may perform requests towards some privileged entity. \
A classic example is using the exposed userspace's syscalls API, and sending arbitrary values for pointers arguments. The kernel have to validate the address range of any pointer arguments, and making sure that they belong to the requested process!
