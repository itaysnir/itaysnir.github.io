## Overview

Based on [kernel-development-learning-pipeline][kernel-development-learning-pipeline]. \
In particular, I'm following the course as it is given within spring 2024. 

This course uses Fedora-40 Linux distribution.

## Lecture 1

Simply an intro & guidelines. 

## Lecture 2 

Mailing list git patches explanation.
TODO: write more about this

## Lecture 3

The kernel build system, `kbuild`. \
`Kconfig` is kind of its own PL, defines what is compiled into the kernel, whats compiled as a separate module, or not compiled at all. \
The `Kconfig` file at `src/linux` simply `source`s all of the `Kconfig` of the various subsystems. \
For example, `mm/Kconfig` describes the various of `CONFIG_*` options for that subsystem.

In order to compile the kernel via its makefile (using `make`), a `.config` file must exists. \
Some distributions, such as Fedora, exports the used `.config` file to build the system within the `/boot` directory, next to the kernel and initramfs.
