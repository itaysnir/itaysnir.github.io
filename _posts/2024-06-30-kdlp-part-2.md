## Lecture 13

Covers character devices - motivation, interaction, implementation.

### Chardevs

Character-by-character kernel interface. Meaning a byte-stream, not buffered, input. For example, keyboard, mouse. But it isn't necessarily related to physical device. \
Character devices can be found under `/dev`, having `c` as file type. Uniquely identified by major (type / category identifier), minor (instance identifier) numbers. Generally, implemented as a kernel module. We can create character (unbuffered) / block (buffered) manually devices via `mknod`. \
Another interesting file is `/proc/devices`, which contains the major to device type mapping. 

### Interaction

Everything is a file. Hence, simple `cat, echo` commands works on the device files. Also syscalls involving fds. 

### Examples

Some useful devices:

```bash
/dev/null  # discard input
/dev/zero  # infinite number of b'\x00' output
/dev/tty   # this terminal, equivalent of R/W from stdin/stdout
/dev/kmsg  # kernel ring buffer access, dmesg parses this
/dev/urandom  # infinite random bytes, crypto-secured
/dev/random  # same, but can block in case system's entropy is low (for example, shortly after boot)
/dev/mem  # Physical memory access!
```

### PRNG Chardev Impl

Demonstration of a basic character device kernel module. We have to perform few steps:

1. Assign major, minor numbers

2. Set file operations - `fops`, that stores addresses of the handlers. 

3. Register device with cdev subsystem

4. Implement handlers for `open, close`

5. Implement handlers for `read, write`

Note: `__init` is a special section of the object, that contains the init functions. It can be reclaimed after module load. 

```c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/errname.h>
#include <linux/fs.h>
#include <linux/cdev.h>
#include <linux/kdev_t.h>


dev_t major_minor;
size_t minor_count = 10;
struct cdev kdlpdev;

int kdlp_open(struct inode * inode, struct file * file) {
    file->private_data = (void *) 0x4141414142424242;
    return 0;
}

int kdlp_close(struct inode * inode, struct file * file) {
    return 0;
}

ssize_t kdlp_read(struct file * file, char * __user buf, size_t count, loff_t * fpos) {

}

ssize_t kdlp_write(struct file * file, const char * __user buf, size_t count, loff_t * fpos) {
    pr_info("write %d:%d\n", imajor(file->f_inode), iminor(file->f_inode));
    return -EFAULT;
}

struct file_operations fops = {
    .owner = THIS_MODULE,
    .open = kdlp_open,
    .release = kdlp_close,
}

int __init kdlpdev_init(void)
{
    int ret = alloc_chrdev_region(&major_minor, 0, minor_count, "kdlpdev");
    if (ret < 0)
    {
        pr_err("major/minor allocation failure: %d(%s)\n", ret, errname(ret));
    }

    char buf[64];
    pr_info("major:minor = %s\n", format_dev_t(buf, major_minor));

    cdev_init(&kdlpdev, &fops);
    cdev_add(&kdlpdev, major_minor, 1);

    return 0;
}

void kdlp_cleanup(void)
{
    unregister_chrdev_region(major_minor, minor_count);
    cdev_del(&kdlpdev);
}

module_init(kdlpdev_init);
module_exit(kdlpdev_exit);
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
```

The major and minor are contained in `dev_t` type, where the CTOR is `MKDEV`, and the getters are `MAJOR, MINOR`. \
We can dynamically allocate the major, minor numbers using `alloc_chrdev_region`, which internally calls `MKDEV`. The static version is `register_chrdev_region`, but it isn't frequently used as collisions between drivers may occur. 

### Necessary Symbols

`struct cdev` - contains the `dev_t`, module owner, `fops` and linked list (for all minors within starting from `dev_t`) and its count, as well as `kobject` for refcounting. 

`struct file_operations` - the function pointers associated with the device. 

`cdev_init` - initializes `cdev`, associates it with a `fops`. 

`cdev_add` - actually adds the `cdev` to the system. It does so by registering the device to the `cdev_map`. 

### Open, Close

`struct inode` - represent information about a file, within certain device, which is represented by the `i_rdev` member. 

`struct file` - encapsulates `struct inode`, and stuff related to the file layer, such as path. 

### Read, Write

We'd use the helper functions `copy_to{from}_user`. Notice the `__user` macro is a syntatic macro, that has no actual runtime effect. \
Notice that EOF is signalled by returning a `0` from the read handler. This can be done, in case `*fpos` passes certain value. 

### Notes

1. Even after unloading the module, and calling the destructor methods, a `kdlpdev` would reside on the non-procfs filesystem. This reference is invalid, and upon performing operations on it - would cause an error. 

2. `file->private_data` usually contains a pointer to a driver-defined struct, which encapsulates the driver's-specific needed datum.

3. Recall we've created devices using `mknod`. Another option is automatic -

### Synchronizing the CPU

The `jiffies` counts CPU timer interrupts since boot, allows calculating time between in-kernel events.
